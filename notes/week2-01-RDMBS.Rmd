## Your Knowledge on Database Management System

Kindly spend few minutes to answer 2 questions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="", fig.align = 'center', warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/istockphoto-1185370773-612x612.jpg")

- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems 

- Commercial websites

- One of the popular RDBMSs for storing spatial data is PostgreSQL

- There are many other types of systems (e.g. MongoDB for storing both relational and non-relational types of data)


## Data Analysis with Excel?

**Excel is a great tool, however it is not optimal for data analytically works.**


<div class='left' style='float:left;width:30%'>
- No error control
- Little reusability
- Problematic scalability
- Low coverage of data operations
- Lack of automation
- Not open
- Difficult collaboration
- Time consuming
- Not user-friendly
- Productionizing is hard
</div>


<div class='left' style='float:left;width:70%'>


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/badexcel.png")
```

</div>





## Relational Database Management System

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap="", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/entitydiagram.png")
```

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>

> The relational model (RM) for database management is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, first described in 1969 by English computer scientist Edgar F. Codd where all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. A database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database.
>
>The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries.

## Examples

### A minute system using MS Access


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/minutesystem.png")
```

- Semi-automation process
- Full automation can be done with development of an WebApp and the App can be integrated with other platforms.


### MySQL and PostgreSQL

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

::: {}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.cap="", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/mysql.png")

## Structure Query Language (SQL)

Again you do not need to be an expert in design/manage databases, you can confidently work with SQL and increase the productivity of works via a few number of functions.


<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>


SELECT

SELECT DISTINCT

WHERE

AND, OR, NOT

ORDER BY

INSERT INTO

NULL VALUES

UPDATE

DELETE

SELECT TOP

MIN and MAX

COUNT, AVG, SUM

FILTER

</div>

**You dont need to remember, there are tons of examples, questions, and answers online. Typing right keywords in Google Search is KEY.** and off course **Practice makes Perfect**

## Other Database Management Systems

There are many other types of data formats that require other types of database management systems/platforms rather than RDMBS. A typical type of data among them is with JSON format and popular used MongoDB platform.

JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation
